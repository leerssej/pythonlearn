<h2>Setting up your PythonLearn Devlopment Environment</h2>
<p>
We have separate pages for each of the commonly used Operating Systems:
<ul>
<li><a href="/software-win.php">Setting up the PythonLearn Environment in Microsoft Windows</a>
<li><a href="/software-mac.php">Setting up the PythonLearn Environment on a Macintosh</a>
<li><a href="/software-pi.php">Setting up the PythonLearn Environment on a Raspberry Pi</a> (New)
</ul>
<p>
<b>Note:</b> Make sure that you have Python 2.6.1 or later but do not install
Python 3.x.  There are signficant differences between Python 2 and Python 3 and this book and class
is still Python 2.
</p>
<p>
You will need 
<a href="http://www.apple.com/quicktime" target=_new>Quicktime</a> 
(or iTunes)
installed on your computer to view any video materials or screencasts.
You should probably download the high quality copies of these
files or screencasts to your computer 
and view/play them 
locally.  They are rather large files and you will want to move 
back and forth as well as start and stop the podcasts so you can perform
the steps as indicated.

<b>Note:</b> This our new software install page - here is the <a href="/software-old.php">former software page</a>.
